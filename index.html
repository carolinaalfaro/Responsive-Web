				<center><p2>The purpose of this webpage is to represent the special 
				importance of cats and coffee to our client, Noël. The artifact 
				that we received from Noël was an mug that symbolizes an array of 
				different meanings to her life. Around five years ago she was gifted 
				this mug by her friend, 11th grade Geometry teacher, Donald Puathasnanon.
				Noël truly loves cats, her favorite breed being Red Tabby cats. She used to
				have a childhood cat that has been with her through many years of her life.
				Additionally she enjoys many different types of coffees such as Americanos,
				Vanilla and Green Tea Lattes, but she enjoys cups of hot coffee the most.
				We incorporated the information given to us and decided to implement the 
				importance of cat cafés in general as well.</p2></center>
